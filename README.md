## Projects
### Thesis: Snow water equalivalent predictions in Utah 

I created a github package that allows users to access, clean, visualize, and analyze data from Snow Data Assimulation System (SNODAS), University of Arizon (UA), Parameter-elevation Regression on Independe Slopes Model (PRISM), and Snow Telemetry (SNOTEL) stations.

1. Install rsnodas from GitHub
2. Download SNODAS, PRISM, and SNOTEL data
3. Create Predictions of the amount of water contained in Snow throughout Utah using a Generalized additive model.
4. Combine by weighting National Products (SNODAS) and Generalized additive model based on the distance from Snow Telemetry stations.

Insert images of the process.
