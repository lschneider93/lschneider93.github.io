## Projects
### Thesis: Snow water equalivalent predictions in Utah (_August 2022_)

I created a github package **R** that allows users to access, clean, visualize, and analyze data from Snow Data Assimulation System (SNODAS), University of Arizon (UA), Parameter-elevation Regression on Independe Slopes Model (PRISM), and Snow Telemetry (SNOTEL) stations.

This is important because Utah is a desert and predicting how much water is available is important.  Utah is one area that national products struggle to predict because of it's mountains.  The goal of this project is to make downloading national data, creating your own predictiongs, and combining with other national products to make another prediction.  This will hopefully help others in their own research and improve the predictions throughout Utah and other places.

1. Install rsnodas from GitHub
2. Download SNODAS, PRISM, and SNOTEL data
3. Create Predictions of the amount of water contained in Snow throughout Utah using a Generalized additive model.
4. Combine by weighting National Products (SNODAS) and Generalized additive model based on the distance from Snow Telemetry stations.

This picture shows the overall process of creating predictions using a Generalized additive model and a weights from the Snow Telemetry stations and combining with SNODAS to get the combined
![Overall Process](/Assets/rsnodas_process.png)

This shows how the median and standard deviation of the errors varies from year to year. Overall there was some improvement by weighting
